        <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>When we started Dugsiiye Online Courses back in 2018, <br>
            our goal was to give Somalis from all across the world
            the ability to learn the skills they’d <br> need to succeed in
            this modern century. We set out to create a new,<br> interactive
            way of learning — making it engaging, flexible, and accessible <br>
            for as many people as possible. Since then, we have helped hundreds
            of <br> Somali people worldwide unlock modern technical skills and reach
            their <br> full potential through code. There are two commitments we've mad
            e to <br> the world. We've been grounded by these since day one: Increase <br> access
            to high-quality education for everyone, everywhere; Enhance <br> teaching and learning
            online through research.
        <h1>Our Vision
        </h1>
        <p>To reach out to all Somali communities through knowledge and to be <br>
            a comprehensive online institute that offers quality-oriented education and accredited certification.</p>

        <h1>Our Mission
        </h1>
        <p> We want to create a world where anyone can build something <br>
            meaningful with technology, and everyone has the learning tools, <br>
            resources, and opportunities to do so. Code contains a world of possibilities <br>
            — all that’s required is the curiosity and drive to learn. At Dugsiiye,<br>
            we are dedicated to empowering all people, regardless of where they are in their <br>
            coding journeys, to continue to learn, grow, and make an impact on the world around them.
